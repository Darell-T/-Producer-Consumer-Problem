# -Producer-Consumer-Problem
This project demonstrates the classic Producer-Consumer Problem using multithreading in C++ with the Windows API. It simulates efficient synchronization between a producer and a consumer in a concurrent programming environment.

Features

	•	Producer Thread: Generates random integers and stores them in a circular buffer.
	•	Consumer Thread: Retrieves and processes integers from the buffer.
	•	Circular Buffer: Used to manage interactions between producer and consumer efficiently.
	•	Synchronization: Ensures proper handling of shared resources using thread synchronization techniques.

This implementation highlights the practical aspects of concurrency and resource
